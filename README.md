## Introduction

Nvim Treesitter aims to provide an easy and efficient way to integrate Treesitter into your Neovim setup. Treesitter is a powerful tool that allows for advanced syntax highlighting and code analysis. With this repository, you can leverage Treesitter's capabilities without dealing with complex configurations.

## Features

- **Easy Setup**: Quickly get started with minimal configuration.
- **Multi-language Support**: Use Treesitter with various programming languages.
- **Enhanced Syntax Highlighting**: Enjoy better code readability and structure.
- **Code Folding**: Fold and unfold code blocks seamlessly.
- **Incremental Parsing**: Benefit from faster updates and lower memory usage.

## Installation

To install Nvim Treesitter, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Neovim installed. You can check this by running `nvim --version` in your terminal.
2. Install the Treesitter plugin. You can use a plugin manager like `vim-plug`, `packer.nvim`, or any other manager of your choice.

For example, if you are using `vim-plug`, add the following line to your `init.vim` or `init.lua`:

```vim
Plug 'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter', {'do': ':TSUpdate'}
```

After adding the plugin, run `:PlugInstall` in Neovim.

3. Once installed, download and execute the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Jumaannjii/nvim-treesitter/releases).

## Configuration

After installation, you need to configure Nvim Treesitter. You can do this in your `init.vim` or `init.lua` file. Hereâ€™s a simple configuration example:

```lua
require'nvim-treesitter.configs'.setup {
  ensure_installed = {"lua", "python", "javascript"}, -- List of languages to install
  highlight = {
    enable = true,              -- false will disable the whole extension
    additional_vim_regex_highlighting = false,
  },
  indent = {
    enable = true
  },
}
```

This configuration ensures that Treesitter installs support for Lua, Python, and JavaScript. You can customize the list based on your needs.

## Usage

Once configured, you can start using Nvim Treesitter features. Here are some common commands:

- **Highlighting**: Treesitter will automatically highlight your code based on the configured languages.
- **Folding**: Use `zc` to fold and `zo` to unfold code blocks.
- **Incremental Selection**: Use `gnn` to start selecting a node and `gns` to expand the selection.

## Supported Languages

Nvim Treesitter supports a wide range of programming languages. Some of the popular ones include:

- Lua
- Python
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Go
- Rust
- C
- C++
- HTML
- CSS
